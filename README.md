## <p align="center"> A lil bit more about the project:

### <p align="center"> Machine Learning based silence-truncation. <br/> Made with Applio / RVC and my Codename-RVC-Fork-4 in mind. ✨ <br/> <br/>
### Features:
- Automatically truncates the silences ( whether dirty / noisy or not.. tho there's limits. It's not a noise-gate trimmer afterall haha. ). <br/>
`While trying to ensure more or less consistent ~100ms spacings ( Some deviations are present and expected. )`
- Respects zero-crossing boundaries.
- Respects breathing ( hopefully.. can't promise much if they're too quiet or way too much noise-like. ).
- Doesn't damage word-tails or inter-phonetic gaps ( unlike gating )
- Truncated areas are automatically replaced by pure silence ( in case of noise-contamination between words or sentences. ).
- No need for user input when it comes to adjusting any params or values. All's handled automatically.

## Scenarios it handles very reliably:

## Scenarios it might fail or the reliability is uncertain:
### 1. <img width="1621" height="751" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1fa04d01-57cf-43c0-b3f1-1bbf819dbbaf" /> <br>
### 2. <img width="1630" height="759" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5638f038-62c2-4904-8268-0de2caeb941f" />
### Therefore, for such " hard cases " ( 1, 2 ) spectral de-noise ( or gating if you're careful ) is recommended.

<br/>
# ⚠️ㅤ**IMPORTANT** ㅤ⚠️
- For now only CUDA ( nvidia ) or CPU.
- Supported sample rates: 32, 40 and 48khz.<br/>
- Silence / Sub-Silence ( noisy ) spacings below 100ms are ignored / not processed by design.
- There are limits, it is still a very-low-noise or pure silence focused truncator.
( So keep in mind models might hiccup on some really hard cases. ) <br/>

## Getting Started:

### INSTALLATION:

Run the installation script:

- Double-click `install.bat`.
 
### PRETRAINED MODELS:

- Download the checkpoint <br/>
[v6_model](https://huggingface.co/Razer112/smartcutter-omi/resolve/main/v6_omi.pth?download=true)<br/>
- Put them in SmartCutter's "ckpts" folder
 
### INFERENCE:
 
To start inference:
- First put the concatenated sample or samples ( .wav or .flac ) into "infer_input" dir.
- Double-click `run-infer.bat`.
- Results will land in "infer_output" dir.<br/>
`( Concatenated = Simply join up all samples / segments into 1 file )`<br/><br/>`NOTE: supports multiple samples AND multiple sr.`
 
### TRAINING:
- Training of custom pretrains is supported. <br/> Instruction regarding that will be published in future.
